# --- Data Exclusion ---
# Jupyter Notebooks
.ipynb_checkpoints/

# Python compiled files
__pycache__/
*.pyc

# Your Data (as discussed)
KaggleCache/

# Alternatively, if you sometimes move data around, standard convention 
# is to keep all data in a 'data/' folder and ignore that:
data/
dataset/
datasets/

# --- File Specific ---
# Ignore large compressed files just in case they end up elsewhere
*.zip
*.tar.gz
*.csv
# !full_df.csv  # (Optional) Exception: Keep the CSV if it's small and necessary for the code to run
